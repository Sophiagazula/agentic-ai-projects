# Agentic AI Projects – Digital Workers for Supply Chain

This repo contains two end-to-end agentic AI prototype notebooks showcasing how digital workers can automate supply chain decision workflows.

## Projects

### 1) Delay Resolution Agent
Detects late-shipment risk using ETA deviation and operational signals, classifies severity, selects recovery actions (notify / escalate / rebook) with autonomy guardrails, and tracks impact metrics (MTTR, OTIF, workload reduction).

📌 Notebook: `delay-resolution-agent/notebooks/DelayResolutionAgent.ipynb`

### 2) Decision Intelligence Agent – Auto Parts
Monitors operational KPIs, detects anomalies, performs root-cause reasoning, and generates executive-ready insights for automotive parts supply chain operations.

📌 Notebook: `decision-intelligence-agent/notebooks/DI-Agent_AutoParts.ipynb`

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## How to Run
Open the notebooks in Google Colab or Jupyter and run all cells.
