# Delay Resolution Agent (Agentic AI Digital Worker)

## Problem
Late shipments require manual triage, causing alert fatigue, slow recovery actions, and missed SLAs.

## Agent Behavior
- Detect risk from ETA deviation and contextual signals
- Classify severity (low/medium/high/critical)
- Decide recovery action (notify, escalate, rebook) using hybrid rules + ML
- Apply autonomy guardrails and human-in-the-loop
- Track MTTR, automation rate, workload reduction, and OTIF proxy
